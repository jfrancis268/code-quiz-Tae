# code-quiz-Tae

This is a pretty simple code quiz that will have a timer that starts at 60 (and eventually will countdown) and will deduct 10 pts from the timer and your score for every wrong answer. It will add 10 pits for every right answer you do get though and also will have a pop up to let you know if it was correct or incorrect. Afterwards you'll be able to save your highscores and start over to try again and your scores will be saved until you decide to clear it.
